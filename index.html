This repository contains tools which use <a href="http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/">larch</a> to test how making
changes to Feff effects the results of EXAFS analysis on real
materials.

<p>
One of the first chores that was done for <a href="https://github.com/xraypy/feff85exafs">Feff85exafs</a> was the creation
of a unit testing framework.  This was used to validate changes made
to the code and to verify that errors were not introduced as changes
were made.  
</p>

<p>
The basis of the unit testing was a sequence of calculations made with
Feff85exafs in the state it was in when it was first released by The
Feff Project.  The unit testing was a lengthy series of comparisons of
numbers and arrays as computed by Feff in its original state and as
computed by the newly compiled version.  Also implemented were a
series of tests to verify that EXAFS fitting results were consistent
between the original and newly compiled Feff.
</p>

<p>
This mechanism of comparing EXAFS fitting results between Feff in two
states was a particularly interesting aspect of the unit testing
framework.  This basic idea of comparing fitting results between Feff
in two states was then expanded to this more generalize testing
framework. 
</p>

<p>
The concept here is that the effect of changes to Feff&rsquo;s theory could
be tested against real data.  A curated set of standards was chosen,
including
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Copper foil</li>
<li>FeS2</li>
<li>NiO</li>
<li>UO2</li>
<li>BaZrO3</li>
<li>bomoadamantane</li>
<li>uranyl hydrate</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of these is a material for which excellent prior knowledge about
the structure of the local configuration environment is known.  For
each of these materials a successful, defensible fitting model is
known.  This allows us to separate the effect of changes in the
theoretical model from uncertainty in assumptions about the structural
configuration. 
</p>

<p>
More specifically, this framework allows testing of the effect of
later versions of Feff compared to the version of Feff6 that has long
been distributed with <a href="https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter">Demeter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/newville/ifeffit">Ifeffit</a>.  (Hint: the answer is that
later versions of Feff have scant effect on EXAFS analysis.)
</p>

<p>
Currently, two tests have been implemented.  One examines the effect
of self-consistent potentials, the other examines the effect of
changing Feff&rsquo;s <code>IORDER</code> parameter.
