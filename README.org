* Feff Testing framework

This repository contains tools which use [[http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/][larch]] to test how making
changes to Feff effects the results of EXAFS analysis on real
materials.

 1. [[use.org][Read the use.org file]] for an explanation of how the testing
    framework work.
 2. [[scf.org][Read the SCF file]] for a discussion of tests of the effect of
    self-consistent potentials on EXAFS fitting.
 3. [[iorder.org][Read the iorder file]] for a discussion of the effect of Feff's
    IORDER parameter on EXAFS fitting.
