All XAS data were processed sensibly in athena with E0 chosen\r\n    to be the first peak of the first derivative in &mu;(E). That\r\n    may not be the best choice of E0 in all cases, but it is the\r\n    obvious first choice and the likeliest choice to be made by a\r\n    novice user of the software.\r\n\r\n2.  All EXAFS data were Fourier transformed starting at 3/&Aring; and\r\n    ending at a reasonable place where the signal was still much\r\n    bigger than the noise. The choice of 3/&Aring; as the starting\r\n    point was deliberate. The\r\n    [autobk algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.47.14126)\r\n    (and most – if not all – other algorithms) are often unreliable\r\n    below about 3/&Aring; due to the fact that the &mu;(E) is changing\r\n    very quickly in that region. Thus the data above 3/&Aring; are\r\n    likely to be reliable a free of systematic error due to the\r\n    details of the background removal.\r\n\r\n3.  All the materials considered have well-known structures. For these\r\n    tests, we want to avoid the situation where error in a fitting\r\n    model could be attributed to incomplete prior knowledge about the\r\n    structure. That is, we want to isolate the details of the fitting\r\n    model from the details of the theoretical calculation.\r\n\r\n4.  The first three examples are dense, crystalline solids for which\r\n    we expect self-consistency to contribute rather little to the\r\n    analysis. The remaining materials all contribute interesting\r\n    features for which self-consistency might play a role.\r\n\r\n5.  In the plots, the ranges of the Fourier transform and of the fit\r\n    are indicated by vertical black lines.\r\n\r\n6.  Each material is fitted using theory from _feff6_, from\r\n    _feff85exafs_ with self-consistency turned off, and from with\r\n    _feff85exafs_ with self-consistency.  In each case, the default\r\n    self-energy model (Hedin-Lundqvist) was used.\r\n\r\n7.  For each material that is not a molecule, the analysis is done\r\n    with a sequence of self-consistency radii. This is done to test\r\n    the importance of the consideration of that parameter on the\r\n    analysis. In the case of hydrated uranyl hydrate, this is a\r\n    molecule, but the feff calculation is done of a crystalline\r\n    analogue to the molecule. The effect of self-consistency radius is\r\n    tested in that case.\r\n\r\n8.  Where appropriate (bromoadamantane, for example), the `lfms`\r\n    parameter of the `SCF` card is set to 1.\r\n\r\n9.  The uranyl calculation was a bit challenging with _feff85exafs_. To\r\n    get the program to run to complation, it was necessary to set the\r\n    FOLP parameter to 0.9 for each unique potential. Given that the\r\n    quality of the fit was much the same as for using _feff6_, this was\r\n    not examined further. Still, this merits further attention for\r\n    this material.\r\n\r\n10. We were interested to know if the effect of SCF on EXAFS fitting\r\n    was different for a first shell fit as compared to a more\r\n    extensive fitting model. So fits were generated for the first\r\n    shells only of all materials except for uranyl hydrate for which\r\n    the axial and equatorial scatterers cannot be isolated. Also, Matt\r\n    tells me that, years ago, he and John looked at some _feff6_/_feff8_\r\n    comparisons, but only for first shell fits. These first shell fits\r\n    are intended for comparison to that older work.  _The results of\r\n    the first shell fits are included in the repository, but not on\r\n    this page as they do not tell a different story from the more\r\n    complete fits presented here._\r\n\r\n11. All fits were performed with a toolset written by Bruce and\r\n    included here in this repository using the XAS analysis\r\n    capabilities of [Larch](https://github.com/xraypy/xraylarch/).\r\n\r\n12. All uncertainties are 1&sigma; error bars determined from the\r\n    diagonal elements of the covarience matrix evaluated during the\r\n    Levenberg-Marquardt minimizations.\r\n\r\n13. The plots shown below for each material were generated using the\r\n    tools in this repository.  You will notice that they appear to be\r\n    highly repetitive.  For each material it is the case that the fits\r\n    using the different theoretical models are nearly\r\n    indistinguishable by eye.  The full complement of fits are shown\r\n    for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nCopper\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe data is the canonical copper foil spectrum of\r\n[Newville, et al. fame](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/issues/29). The\r\nfitting model is very simple. There is an S0&sup2; parameter (`amp`),\r\nan energy shift for all paths (`enot`), and a volumetric lattice\r\nexpansion coefficient (`alpha`). The &sigma;&sup2; values for all paths\r\nwere computed using the correlated Debye model and a temperature of\r\n10K, except for the first shell, which has its own &sigma;&sup2;\r\nvariable (`ss1`).\r\n\r\nThe fit included 4 coordination shells, which includes several\r\ncollinear multiple scattering paths of the same distance as the fourth\r\nshell single scattering path.\r\n\r\n`amp` and `alpha` are unitless. `enot` is eV, `ss1` is &Aring&sup2;, and\r\n`thetad` is K.\r\n\r\nBest fit values\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n|model|alpha|amp|enot|ss1|thetad|\r\n|:----|:----|:--|:---|:--|:-----|\r\n|feff6|-0.00074(92)|0.96(4)|4.97(49)|0.00382(33)|253(22)|\r\n|noSCF|-0.00046(90)|0.95(4)|5.71(48)|0.00400(33)|239(19)|\r\n|withSCF(3)|-0.00077(104)|0.94(5)|3.45(56)|0.00402(38)|241(22)|\r\n|withSCF(4)|-0.00076(104)|0.94(5)|3.54(56)|0.00402(38)|242(22)|\r\n|withSCF(5)|-0.00077(104)|0.94(5)|3.40(56)|0.00402(38)|241(22)|\r\n|withSCF(5.5)|-0.00077(105)|0.94(5)|3.41(56)|0.00402(38)|241(22)|\r\n|withSCF(6)|-0.00076(104)|0.94(5)|3.46(56)|0.00402(38)|241(22)|\r\n\r\nStatistics\r\n----------\r\n\r\n|model|&chi;&sup2;|&chi;&sup2;_&nu;|R|\r\n|:----|---------:|-------------:|--------------:|\r\n|feff6|1444.2957|54.3832|0.0145|\r\n|noSCF|1414.0154|53.2430|0.0142|\r\n|withSCF(3)|1820.7826|68.5594|0.0182|\r\n|withSCF(4)|1814.3186|68.3160|0.0182|\r\n|withSCF(5)|1816.7825|68.4088|0.0182|\r\n|withSCF(5.5)|1823.5990|68.6654|0.0183|\r\n|withSCF(6)|1819.3955|68.5071|0.0182|\r\n\r\n\r\nFits\r\n----\r\n\r\n| feff6 | no SCF | SCF, R=3 | SCF, R=4 | SCF, R=5 | SCF, R=5.5 | SCF, R=6 |\r\n|-------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\r\n|![fit with feff6](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_feff6.png) | ![fit with feff8 no SCF](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_noSCF.png) | ![fit with feff8, SCF, R=3](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_withSCF_3.png)| ![fit with feff8, SCF, R=4](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_withSCF_4.png)| ![fit with feff8, SCF, R=5](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_withSCF_5.png)| ![fit with feff8, SCF, R=5.5](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_withSCF_5.5.png)| ![fit with feff8, SCF, R=6](https://github.com/bruceravel/SCFtests/blob/master/Copper/scf/fit_withSCF_6.png)|\r\n\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n\r\nNiO\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe sample was NiO powder prepared by my colleague Neil Hyatt\r\n(University of Sheffield) and checked by him for phase purity.

The data are taken\r\nfrom\r\n[Matt’s online collection of references](http://cars.uchicago.edu/~newville/ModelLib/search.html).\r\n\r\nThe model includes a S0&sup2; parameter (`amp`), an energy shift (`enot`),\r\nand a volumetric lattice expansion coefficient (`alpha`). The first\r\nand second shell S scatterers each get a &sigma;&sup2; parameter (`ss` and\r\n`ss2`). The third shell of S atoms only contains 2 scatterers.

The data were measured by Bruce at NSLS beamline\r\nX23A2.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting test case because it is a molecule (thus the\r\nentire molecule can be included in the self-consistency calculation)\r\nand because there is measureable scattering from the neighboring\r\nhydrogen atoms.
